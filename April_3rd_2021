I took yesterday off for a much needed break. I'll continue a bit today, but I don't think I'll go too in depth. 
Continuing with array and object methods from two days ago, here is a summary of what I've covered today:

> Object.keys() ---> take all keys from the object in the brackets and return an array of those keys.

Feeling pretty confident in my ability to create, alter and deal with arrays and objects. It helped that this wasn't my first run-through thanks to the course I took on LinkedIn. Same information + new context = reinforced mental connections.

I'll continue the tutorial for now - the next chapter is an introduction to basic algorithm scripting. We'll see how this goes:

Challenge #1: create a function that takes a string and reverses it.
  > I was successful! Here is my answer. I'm sure there is a simpler way of doing it with less code, but for now I'm just happy that I got the answer:
    function reverseString(str) {
  let arr = str.split('');
  let reverseArr = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    reverseArr.unshift(arr[i]);
  }
  let finalString = reverseArr.join('');
  return finalString;
}

reverseString("hebedawee");
