I started today by reviewing the concepts I learned yesterday regarding Objects and Object Oriented Programming. There was a lot to unpack there, but I'm feeling pretty comfortable with my grasp on those concepts for now. I'm really glad that I spent the time documenting all those examples and concepts - it will be very useful to be able to revisit these entries later on and review concepts written in my own words (not just Stack Overflow).

Today, I'm starting the second to last chapter in this tutorial about 'Functional Programming'. So far, I've learned the basic terms:

** First Class Functions ---> All functions in javascript are first class functions. This means that they can be passed into arguments, returned within other functions or even be stored as variables.

** Higher Order Functions ----> these are functions that can take other functions as arguments, or are able to return other functions.

** Lambda's ----> These are the functions that can be used as arguments to other functions or returned within other functions.
