Nearing the finish of day two on the new job and I've been loving every minute of it. 

My hard work and attention to detail has paid off big time. Once I got set up on all the day-to-day tech (Slack, Asana, Humi, Harvest...) and spent some time getting familiar I basically hopped right in to coding!

My first project was to replicate a Hero component that was designed on Figma. I used Storybook to get a visual rendering of it and just completed it an hour ago.

I can already tell how much I'm going to learn in the next few weeks, particularly in CSS. I'm having to be much pickier with how I organize my grids and flex box designs and get used to using "rems" as the sizing unit for pretty much everything. I had the most difficulty figuring out how to use flex box to my advantage in centering the layouts but figured out that you can do a flex-direction: column for the main working area to help keep everything aligned. After that, the standard flex-direction: row components slide right in.

We'll see what kind of feedback I receive. I cleaned up the code quite a bit afterwards and got it to be decently responsive. Next step => push to gitHub!
