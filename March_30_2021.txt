Today I worked through a ton of exercises on FreeCodeCamp that dealt with Regex in JavaScript.
I find that when I get on a roll like this, it's easy for me to gloss over the content and not give it a chance to truly sink in.
To help with this, when I successfully finished a challenge, I instantly tried to duplicate it on my code editor with a live port set up so I could see my tweaks and results in real time.
This has been a recent discovery in my learning, but has already cemented a lot of concepts for me. I used this to play around with object creation. 

Today I covered:

> The .test() and .match() methods.
> Using "g" flags to find more than just the first match.
> Using "i" flags to find matches regardless to case.
> Using the "." as a wildcard.
> Match ranges of letters and numbers using brackets (eg. [a-e] and [1-7].
> Match characters that occur one or more times, like the 'S' in "Mississippi" using /s+/.
> Exlude certain characters using the ' ^ ' symbol.
> Use ' * ' to match characters that occur 0 or more times (eg. Using /go*/ on "GOOOAL" would return "GOOO" and on "geese" it would return just "g".
> Finally, I just finished learning about using " ? " to create lazy matching, but I'm feeling a little overloaded with information at the moment and that concept hasn't really sunk in yet.

Later on that evening I had a little bit of energy left, so I watched a youtube series about node.js and npm. It was by the same guy who did the GitHub series that I enjoyed and this also really cleared some things up for me. Node.js is simply a program that allows you to run javascript outside of the web browser. You can run it directly in the command line and, more importantly, server side!

Lots of good progress today - I'll continue to experiment as much as I can on my code editor in the meantime.
If I have a little more energy tonight I'll continue to work on my CSS violin and my other HTML projects on Codepen.
