Today I'm continuing with my Regex tutorial in FreeCodeCamp. Before I even dove in, I did practiced on a random string in my code editor and a lot of the concepts stuck. :)

I'll keep a running tab of the concepts I covered today: 
  > Use the "$" after the expression to search for an item at the end of a string, using the test method. (eg. let test = myRegex.test(myString)).
  > The "\w" character is used as a shorthand for all alpha-numeric characters (A-Z, 0-9, and underscore). Use /\w+/ to find words, and single "w" for characters.
  > Use "\W" to find everything BUT alphanumeric characters (works just like the '^').
  > Use "\d" as a short hand to search for all digits (0-9).
  > Use "\D" to find everything BUT digits (again, works just like the '^').
  
  ** DON'T FORGET TO USE THE 'gi' FLAGS TO INCLUDE CAPITALIZATION AND REPEATED ITEMS. **
  
  Just before I broke for lunch, I solved this tricky problem using Regex. Here were the parameters: 
  
    1) Usernames can only use alpha-numeric characters.

    2) The only numbers in the username have to be at the end. There can be zero or more of them at the end. Username cannot start with the number.

    3) Username letters can be lowercase and uppercase.

    4) Usernames have to be at least two characters long. A two-character username can only use alphabet letters as characters.
    
    I got close, and ulitmately had to use a few hints. Here was the solution:
    
      /^[a-z][a-z]+\d*$|^[a-z]\d\d+$/i
      
      - So it has to start with two letters at least (the " ^ " followed by two complete alphabet expressions), the plus sign meaning it will allow duplicate letters to follow.
      - then, if this is the case, you're allowed to follow up with any digit (\d) or none at all if you please (hence the *) but ONLY at the end ($). 
      - This full combination of expressions ensure that it's at least two characters long. 
      - The vertical line " | " indicates an "or" expression, so the other option is:
      - Start with a letter, followed by a number and then another number at the end. 
      
    This covered all of their examples. It was a challenging one for me to wrap my head around so I think I'll tinker with it a bit and call it for now.
    
    Back from lunch, I decided to continue for a bit more:
    
    > "\s" matches all whitespace in a string.
    > Similarly, "\S" matches everything BUT whitespace.
    > Specify quantities using {} with a lower and upper limit number. This is more specific than using "+" or "*". 
    > Use a " ? " to indicate that the character that precedes it is optional (eg. Color and Colou?r).
    > Positive callbacks are notated with (?=...) and check to see if the following exists. Negative check that the opposite is true (?!...).
    > Use () to check for mixed characters (eg. (franklin | teddy | eleanor) Rosevelt.)
