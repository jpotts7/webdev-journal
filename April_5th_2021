After a morning practice session (and one violin student) I was happy to spend the rest of the afternoon continuing with JavaScript tutorials.
To break this up a bit more, I watched a youtube video that discussed a recommended "learning roadmap" for front end development.
I have several sources that I reference in regards to this (really helpful as I am entirely self taught) and I'm happy to report that I seem to be following a good path. I haven't been getting distracted as much in terms of my learning these days - even just a few weeks ago I found myself jumping from project to project and concept to concept, trying to cover all my bases. What can I say? It's exciting to be learning this and I'm eager to get up and running as soon as I can! That said, if being a professional musician has taught me anything in life it's that quality cannot be rushed.

Anyways. Continuing with the JavaScript algorithm projects:

** Check if a string (first argument, str) ends with the given target string (second argument, target). **

function confirmEnding(str, target) {
  let newArr = str.slice(-(target.length));
  let answer = newArr == target ? true : false;
  return answer;
}

confirmEnding("Bastian", "n");

I still really enjoy seeing how others solve the problem, but my method was mentioned as one of four usual approaches so that was nice!
I had to do a little review on the differences between "split" (for strings), "slice" (for strings and arrays), and "splice"(for arrays only, and alters the original array). I also decided to write my "if/else" statements with the shorthand method to switch things up.

The next problem look really simple at first, but it took me a little while to figure out:

** Repeat a given string str (first argument) for num times (second argument). Return an empty string if num is not a positive number. **

Of course this would have been a piece of cake if I were allowed to use the string.repeat() method.... here was my solution:

function repeatStringNumTimes(str, num) {
  let repeatedString = "";
    while (num > 0) {
      repeatedString += str.slice(0);
      num--;
    }
  return repeatedString;
}

repeatStringNumTimes("abc", 3); (This returns "abc" three times in a row).

I was proud of myself for using a while loop AND remembering to subtract the num value by one afterwards so I didn't get an infinite loop...
The str.slice method was absolutely unecessary - I could have just as well written "repeatedString += str". I didn't even think of that until just now, but I guess I had the slice method still fresh in my mind from the previous challenge.
