I'm continuing to take a mental break from practicing - violin has been and always will be an integral part of my life, and I have to be very wary about burnout and "pushing through", especially during Covid. There's no point in forcing it when there are no performances on the horizon. Perhaps, if I have the energy, I will try and do a half hour or so of technique today, to keep the rust from forming. As of right now though, I really want to spend a lot of time studying React and continuing with the tutorial.
