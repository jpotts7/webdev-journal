I'm feeling really optimistic and proud of myself for the progress I've been making. At this rate, I feel like I have a good chance of finishing the JavaScript tutorial (with projects), AND completing the Front-End Frameworks on FreeCodeCamp, which covers React and Sass, among other extremely useful programs. Once that's out of the way, I think I'll be confident enough to apply for some entry level work in July!
