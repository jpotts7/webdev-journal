I'm feeling really optimistic and proud of myself for the progress I've been making. At this rate, I feel like I have a good chance of finishing the JavaScript tutorial (with projects), AND completing the Front-End Frameworks on FreeCodeCamp, which covers React and Sass, among other extremely useful programs. Once that's out of the way, I think I'll be confident enough to apply for some entry level work in July!

First algorithm challenge of the day:

** Truncate a String if it is longer than the given number argument and add "..." **

Here is my solution:

function truncateString(str, num) {
  let shortString = ""
  if (str.length > num) {
    return shortString += str.slice(0, num) + "...";
  } else {
    return str;
  }
}

I tried using the shorthand notation for the if/else statement, but I couldn't get it to work - it kept returning "undefined". Perhaps I'll keep that method for simpler statements for now. (** After further reading, it was because I didn't include "return" BEFORE the shorthand statement.**)

Challenge #2:

** Look through an array and return the first element that passes the truth test **

My solution:

function findElement(arr, func) {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (func(arr[i]) === true) {
      return arr[i];  
    }
}
}

This one confused me at first because I thought it was a function that divided, and not one that found the remainder. It was pretty easy after that.
