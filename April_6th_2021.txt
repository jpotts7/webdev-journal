I'm feeling really optimistic and proud of myself for the progress I've been making. At this rate, I feel like I have a good chance of finishing the JavaScript tutorial (with projects), AND completing the Front-End Frameworks on FreeCodeCamp, which covers React and Sass, among other extremely useful programs. Once that's out of the way, I think I'll be confident enough to apply for some entry level work in July!

First algorithm challenge of the day:

** Truncate a String if it is longer than the given number argument and add "..." **

Here is my solution:

function truncateString(str, num) {
  let shortString = ""
  if (str.length > num) {
    return shortString += str.slice(0, num) + "...";
  } else {
    return str;
  }
}

I tried using the shorthand notation for the if/else statement, but I couldn't get it to work - it kept returning "undefined". Perhaps I'll keep that method for simpler statements for now.
