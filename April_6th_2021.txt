I'm feeling really optimistic and proud of myself for the progress I've been making. At this rate, I feel like I have a good chance of finishing the JavaScript tutorial (with projects), AND completing the Front-End Frameworks on FreeCodeCamp, which covers React and Sass, among other extremely useful programs. Once that's out of the way, I think I'll be confident enough to apply for some entry level work in July!

First algorithm challenge of the day:

** Truncate a String if it is longer than the given number argument and add "..." **

Here is my solution:

function truncateString(str, num) {
  let shortString = ""
  if (str.length > num) {
    return shortString += str.slice(0, num) + "...";
  } else {
    return str;
  }
}

I tried using the shorthand notation for the if/else statement, but I couldn't get it to work - it kept returning "undefined". Perhaps I'll keep that method for simpler statements for now. (** After further reading, it was because I didn't include "return" BEFORE the shorthand statement.**)

Challenge #2:

** Look through an array and return the first element that passes the truth test **

My solution:

function findElement(arr, func) {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (func(arr[i]) === true) {
      return arr[i];  
    }
}
}

This one confused me at first because I thought it was a function that divided, and not one that found the remainder. It was pretty easy after that.

Challenge #3:

** Capitalize the first letter of each word in a string **

I thought this would be an easy one - turns out not so much.
I got a solution to work on my code editor, but FreeCodeCamp didn't accept it. I don't blame them - it's not very elegant:

 function titleCase(str) {
  let newString = "";
  let stringArr = str.split(" ");
  for (let i = 0; i < stringArr.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < stringArr[i].length; j++) {
      if (j === 0) {
        newString += stringArr[i][j].toUpperCase();
      } else {
        newString += stringArr[i][j].toLowerCase();
      }
  }
  newString += " ";
  }
  return newString;
 }

console.log(titleCase("HERE IS MY HANDLE")); 

All of their solutions used the replace method, which is something I'm not quite familiar with. They also used regex which is slowly becoming less familiar to me as well. Time to do a little review.

This is the answer I liked:

function titleCase(str) {
  var convertToArray = str.toLowerCase().split(" ");
  var result = convertToArray.map(function(val) {
    return val.replace(val.charAt(0), val.charAt(0).toUpperCase());
  });
  return result.join(" ");
}

titleCase("I'm a little tea pot");

Here, by using the map method, you can apply a function that takes each item in the array (val) and replace the first character of it with an uppercase character. There's a lot of punctuation to remember, but this is a method I would like to use at some point again in the near future.
