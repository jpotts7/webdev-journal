I'm getting a little stuck with the JavaScript intermediate problems at the moment. I think the best thing for me right now to keep my motivation up and give me a fresh perspective is to step away for a bit and dive into the front-end frameworks tutorial for a bit. I could spend an eternity on JavaScript but right now I feel like I have a solid enough foundation (practically speaking) and will continue to research, learn and revisit these problems over the course of the next few weeks.

The first chapter deals with Bootstrap - I've heard a lot about this program and I'm looking forward to learning about it's practical uses!

A brief summary of what I've learned so far:

1) Include a link to bootstrap in the head. (It's a long url - you can find it online).

2) Wrap ALL of the html in a div with a class "container-fluid" - I'm not sure if this is a bootstrap specific class or if this is just how FreeCodeCamp wanted me to do it. 

3) To make images responsive, add a class called "imp-responsive" :D

4) Center text by adding the class "text-center" to whatever element you choose.

5) Use bootstrap buttons by making a button element and using the classes "btn" and "btn-default"

6) Use "btn-block" class to create a button that spans a whole block, not just the length of the text. 

7) Use "ban-primary" in place of "bin-default" to give your button the primary color of your page.
