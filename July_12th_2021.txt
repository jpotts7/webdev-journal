First day of my second week is off to a pretty good start!

I spent the morning and most of the early afternoon working on my second sandbox component: a features component for Kubernetes.

Something things that I found easier this time around were:

1) Navigating their design system and files.
2) Using Javascript to map over data and create components dynamically (wohoo!!)
3) Importing/exporting files and components.
4) Using devtools and storybook to troubleshoot.
5) Becoming more efficient and using Figma data to replicate designs.

I'm still having trouble knowing when and how to use height and width properties on elements. It should be so basic but I get hung up on max vs min and all the different units that can be used for different circumstances. 
My control of flex box is improving, though I think I may have over-used it in this particular project. I'm sure that will be a part of my feedback later. 

I made my first PR for this new component so I'll take a break from coding for now and read through some of the docs for Sanity - in a few weeks I will be tasked with using Loom to create video walkthroughs of Sanity for different clients. This will be a great way to dip my toes into the back end side of things!
