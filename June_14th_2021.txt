After spending some time reading the docs about Next.JS (and completing their blog tutorial) I realized that they were using some Node expressions that I wasn't familiar with. I found a decent "Intro to Node" course on LinkedIn that I've been working my way through today and I've come to realize several things:

1) My JavaScript skills have improved immensely. Even though I'm learning new functionalities, the logic all makes sense - hurray!

2) Frequent core modules that I see in code (Require, Fs...) all make sense now. It really wasn't so difficult!

I know that my focus will be on front end for now, but it's time I start dipping my toes in backend code more and more. I feel like it will greatly expand my perspective and improve my javascript overall. 

I'm going to pause on that for now and add my React Pace Calculator to my portfolio page. More after lunch!
