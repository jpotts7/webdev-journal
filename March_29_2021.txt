I was having quite a bit of trouble making sense of how git and GitHub worked together. 
I knew how git worked (able to work my way around it, at least) and how valuable a tool version control can be.
But how did it communicate with GitHub? I tried several courses on linkedIn and the GitHub Learning Lab but it didn't quite click for me.
Until today.
I stumbled across this great YouTube channel called "The Coding Train" and dove into a series about git and GitHub.
The videos weren't as refined as others, and the host frequently made errors and made jokes at his expense. But in the end, that's what made it work for me.
He communicated the concepts very well, and the visuals were a huge help for me.
Now I know how to properly use "git clone", "git push" and "git pull", in addition to initializing a local repository and pushing it up to GitHub.

My hope is that this journal will allow me to use my git skills frequently and give me a platform to pose problems I've encountered and allow me to revisit and ammend posts at a later date.
That's all for now. Time to resume my JavaScript course on FreeCodeCamp.
