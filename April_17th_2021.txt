It's a cold, rainy Saturday and I'm looking forward to really diving in and seeing how much of this front end framework tutorial I can work through today.

I'm picking up where I left off yesterday with Sass.

** You can use 'for' loop logic in Sass and you have two options: a 'through' (includes the last item) and a 'to' (not the last item). Here's how it looks in practice:

@for $i from 1 to 6 {
  .text-#{$i} {font-size: 15px * $i;}
}

This will print out the text with the class "text-n" in increasing sizes. 
The #{} syntax lets Sass know to convert it to a string in the real css file:

.text-#{$I} == .text-1, .text-2, etc.

Ok, now things are getting a little abstract. The next exercise is covering how you can use "each" on lists, assigning a variable to the current value from that list item.

Ex. @each $color in blue, black, red {
  .#{$color}-bg {background-color: $color};
}

The colours to be changed are listed at the top, then you map that variable to each "color-bg" class. You can achieve the same result using mapping over key:value pairs:

$colors: (color1: blue, color2: red, color3: green);

@each $key, $color in $colors {
  .#{$color}-text {color: $color;}
}

Here, you define a "colours" object variable, and then map over each key in that object using "@each $key" (which is a "color" in the object "colours").

I think this is clear and that I'm explaining it correctly. I believe I understand each concept, it's just a matter of knowing WHEN to use them. Context is everything, and I guess that will just come with practice. I should spend some time today reading other people's sass code.
