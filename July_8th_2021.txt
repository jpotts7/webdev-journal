I think I've learned more in the past three days than I would have in an entire month of self learning.
While my brain feels like it's going to explode I absolutely love the work I'm doing right now and can already see how the struggle will pay off immensely in a few short weeks.

I've spent virtually my whole time replicating a website design given to me on Figma using React components and a whole lot of CSS. I think I finally finished the first main "Hero" component and am awaiting the feedback for my pull request.

In the meantime, some quick reflections:

Styled-components are super cool. I even learned how to use switch statements within them to render the css of OTHER styled components that I imported from different design files.

Recently, I made a typography file that made a styled-component for each type of font style I will encounter. I imported this into a Text component, which renders a "$Text" styled component that draws its info from the passed in typography styles.

I hope I explained that clearly? In any case, here is my code for future reference:

import React from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'
import {
  $TextXs,
  $TextSm,
  $TextReg,
  $TextLg,
  $TextXl,
  $Text2xl,
  $Text3xl,
  $Text4xl,
  $Text5xl,
  $Text6xl,
  $Text7xl,
  $Text8xl,
  $Text9xl,
} from '../Design/typography'

export const $Text = styled.div`
  ${({ textStyle }) => {
    switch (textStyle) {
      case 'xs':
        return $TextXs
      case 'sm':
        return $TextSm
      case 'base':
        return $TextReg
      case 'lg':
        return $TextLg
      case 'xl':
        return $TextXl
      case '2xl':
        return $Text2xl
      case '3xl':
        return $Text3xl
      case '4xl':
        return $Text4xl
      case '5xl':
        return $Text5xl
      case '6xl':
        return $Text6xl
      case '7xl':
        return $Text7xl
      case '8xl':
        return $Text8xl
      case '9xl':
        return $Text9xl
    }
  }}
`

export default function Text({ children, textStyle = 'xl' }) {
  return <$Text textStyle={textStyle}>{children}</$Text>
}

I'm also becoming more and more comfortable using and passing around props and dealing with flex box. Looking forward to whatever comes next!
